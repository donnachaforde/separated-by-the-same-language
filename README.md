## Preface
I started to put this catalogue together because of years of noticing minor differences between writen and spoken English in the US, Ireland and the UK. Some of the differences in meaning and interpretation are amusing so I've long since considered capturing some of these anomalies. 

While a native speaker of the English language, I am not a lingustic expert so the following is merely an assembly of observations from:

* Growing up in Ireland where we speak an 'Irish' version of English - i.e. local EN-IE. 
* Working and living in the UK for almost a decade. 
* Working for US Multinationals for over 25 years. 

Professionally, I've found myself having to adapt the written word for the majority of the intended audience, usually american. I 'whince' ever so slightly at the mis-spellings I deliberately make with reflections of my primary school education in the back of my mind. Eventually, I've given in and changed my spell-checker to US-EN. 


## Spelling & Conventions
It's worth reminding ourselves of the primary spelling differences between English and American-English. The latter tends to rely on more phonetic spelling. 

* Words ending in 'our' tend to be spelt as 'or' - e.g. 'colour' and 'neighbour' are spelt as 'color' and 'neighbor' - but not words like 'tour'.
* The more observant will have picked up on my usage of 'spelt' rather than 'spelled' in the point above. It's been my experience that Americans will tend not to use the former. So, for example, you tend to see 'learned' rather than 'learnt' in written US-English. 


## Phrases 

| UK&I Phrase| Meaning | US Equivalent | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "That's like turkeys voting for Christmas." | What your supporting does not serve your own interests. | N/A | I was surprised to learn this phrase didn't resonate in the US. Of course, turkeys have more of an association with 'Thanksgiving' there and Christmas is arguably not the main holiday of the year.


| US Phrase| Meaning | UK&I Equivalent | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "Speak to" | A reference towards someone's ability to talk about a particular topic. e.g. John can speak to that.  | "Speak about" | It's more common to hear people say, for example, "John can speak about that" rather than "to that" in both the UK and Ireland.
