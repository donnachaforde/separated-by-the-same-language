# separated-by-the-same-language
A living catalogue of different words and phrases across the English language 

>**Note**: George Bernard Shaw was quoted in 1942 as saying, "England and America are two countries separated by the same language."

## Preface
This page attempts to capture some of the 'quirks' in how the English language is used between the US and the UK and Ireland (UK&I).Over the years I've found some of differences in interpretation of words, turn of phrase and even pronunciation can be a little amusing. 


While a native speaker of the English language, I am not a linguistic expert so the following is merely an assembly of observations from:

* Growing up in Ireland where we speak an 'Irish' version of English - i.e. locale EN-IE. 

* Working and living in the UK for almost a decade. 

* Working for US Multinationals for over 25 years where I've worked with Americans from all over the country. 

Professionally, I've found myself having to adapt the written word for the audience, the majority of which are usually American. I 'wince' ever so slightly at the 'mis-spellings' I deliberately make with flashbacks to my primary school education. Eventually, after many years of _fighting the good fight_, I gave in and changed my spell-checker to US-EN. Now, I have to consciously adapt my spelling when messaging Europeans. 


## Spelling & Conventions
It's worth reminding ourselves of the primary spelling differences between English and American-English. The latter tends to rely on more phonetic spelling. 

* Words ending in 'our' tend to be spelt as 'or' - e.g. 'colour' and 'neighbour' are spelt as 'color' and 'neighbor' - but not words like 'tour'.

* Words that pronounce 's' at the end are usually replaced with 'z' - e.g. 'realize' and 'serialize'. 

* Words that have a slightly different spelling to donate the noun and verb, like 'licence' and 'license' respectively are not differentiated in US English. 

* Along the theme of phonetics, other word spellings vary - e.g. 'grey' is used in other English speaking countries whereas 'gray' is more common in the US.

* The more observant will have picked up on my usage of 'spelt' rather than 'spelled' in the point above. It's been my experience that Americans will tend not to use the former. So, for example, you tend to see 'learned' rather than 'learnt' in written US-English. 

* Certain words are spelt with both the trailing 're' or 'er' - e.g. 'centre' and 'center' in the UK and Ireland but only the latter is used in the US. 

* The older spelling of 'program' is 'programme'. You'll see both spellings in the UK&I but only the former in the US. 


## Turn of Phrase 


| US-EN Phrases | UK & Ireland Phrases | Details | 
| :-------- | :--- | :--- |
| "Speak to" | "Speak about" | A reference towards someone's ability to talk about a particular topic. e.g. "John can speak to that" or "I can speak to that".  In both the UK and Ireland, it's more common to hear people say, for example, "John can speak about that" or "I can speak about that". |
| "Touch base" | "Catch ya later" | This phrase is used in the US English to mean I'll be be in contact as in "I'll touch base with you about that" or "can you touch base with John to confirm that". I believe the expression originated in baseball and simply means that someone will contact another person. I reckon a close UK&I equivalent is "I'll catch up with you later".   |
| N/A | "That's like turkeys voting for Christmas." | What your supporting does not serve your own interests. <br><br>I was surprised to learn this phrase didn't resonate in the US. Of course, turkeys have more of an association with 'Thanksgiving' and not necessarily Christmas as on might expect in UK&I. |
| "Run it up the flag pole" | "Try it out" or "Give it a go" | I believe this is a shortened version of "Run it up the flagpole and see who salutes it.", meaning "let's try it out and see if it works". <br> A common turn of phrase in the UK might be to "give it a whirl" and in Ireland it might be to "give it a lash". The latter can also be used in the content of encouragement as in "Give it a go!". |


## Pronunciation 
This is one of more quirky differences, which of course is only apparent in spoken English. This is where I draw the line on making accommodations for our American cousins... :-) Here, I speak normally as the word is usually out before I can adapt anyway so instead I'd typically add "...or as you Americans say...". 



| Word | US | UK&I | 
| :-------- | :--- | :--- |
| aluminum & aluminium| _"alu-min-um"_ | _"alu-min-ee-um"_ |
| basil | _"baaz-ill"_ | _"baz-ill"_ | 
| lever | _"lev-er"_ | _"leev-er"_ | 
| oregano | _"oreg-ano"_ | _"ore-gano"_ |
| niche | _"nitch"_ | _"neesh"_ | 
| route & router | _"wrout"_ and _"wrouter"_ | _"root_ and _"rooter"_| 


>**Note**: There seems to be a lot going on with the pronunciation of 'herbs'. It seems ever that word itself isn't sacred with the leading 'h' being dropped in the US and pronounced as _"eerbs"_. 

## Different Words for the Same Thing
In many cases, we have quite different words for the same thing. 

| US | UK&I | Example | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| sidewalk | footpath |
| elevator | lift |
| hood (car) | bonnet |
| trunk (car)| boot |
| practice | training | e.g. "I brought my kids to training/practice yesterday." |
| cleats (football) | studs | | 


## Conventions & Measurements

* In the US, the ground floor of a building is Floor 1. The next floor up is Floor/Level 2. In Europe, the ground floor is just the ground floor and the next level up is the 'First Floor'. (i.e. count from 1 versus count from 0).

* In the US, many taller buildings do not have a '13th' floor as it's considered to be unlucky.

* The US uses Imperial while most of Europe uses Metric. However, the UK still measure things like distance and speed-limits in miles/mph but scientific and engineering work uses metric. 

* Temperature is measured in Fahrenheit in both the US and the UK but Celsius is used in Ireland and the rest of Europe.

* The US measures distance in miles, which is the same as the UK mile. While speed limits are measured in kph/kmph in Ireland, many older people will still think of distance in miles. 

* Likewise, many older people in Ireland will judge weight using Imperial measures but think in terms of 'stones' and 'pounds' whereas the US only thinks in terms of 'pounds'. e.g. _"That guy must be over 250 pounds."_ versus _"That guy must be 18 stones."_

* Ireland adopted the Metric system in the mid-70's shortly after joining the EU, then known as the EEC. Consequently, many generations still work in both Imperial and Metric. 

* A pint of beer in the US is smaller than a pint in the UK. Beer is served in pint sizes in Ireland too (as 568ml).
